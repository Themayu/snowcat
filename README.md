# Contributing

Snowcat isn't open for contributions yet. It is very early in development, and
I am very bad at remembering to push changes to the repository so any
contributions made will likely be made on a very old version of the source
code. I'm not even sure what code style or architecture I want with it right
now; I'm still experimenting.[^fmt-note]

[^fmt-note]: And please, don't just clone the repository, run `cargo fmt`, try 
to submit the result as a PR, and call that a "contribution." That's not
contributing. That's just drive-by rudeness.
